# Exercises for Programmers using Blazor WebAssembly

These are my solutions to the exercises in the book '[Exercises for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers)' so I can learn about working with '[Blazor WebAssembly](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)' based solutions, and study some CSS application, especially Bootstrap, on the way.

*Beware:* These might not necessarily be the best or most proper solutions. They just adhere to the requirements for the task.
But if you see any gross mistakes or have some great improvement remarks, then please feel free to contact me. It is after all a learning experience.
